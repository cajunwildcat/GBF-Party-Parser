# GBF Party Wiki Exporter

Bookmarklet that generates a gbf.wiki formatted TeamSpread of the currently open team page and copies it to your clipboard.

## Installation

- Copy [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cajunwildcat/GBF-Party-Parser/main/bookmarklet) code and paste it into the URL bar of a new bookmark in the browser you use to play GBF.
- Go to a party team and press click the bookmark
- Click the okay button in the pop-up to have the team copied to your clipboard for easy pasting access.

## Why use this bookmarklet

This bookmarklet makes use of a kept up to date databse of character and summon IDs in this repo to get more accurate names. This means it is able to accurate differentiate between characters with multiple versions such as `Vira` and `Vira (Grand)`. The names are set according to the page names on the gbf.wiki so you should not have to edit anything.

A smaller feature, but opening the estimated damage panel in order to get more accurate Support Summon data.

## Limitations

- Newly added characters and summons will not be grabbed properly and break functionality. Please wait a day or two after their release before using the bookmarklet on teams including them.
- To get more accurate Support Summon data (LB & Transcendence) you have to open the Estimated Damage panel at least once. Afterwards you can close it and use the bookmark as much as you want until you reload the page or switch teams.
  - Otherwise only the summon name will be filled out.
- More detailed information about characters such as their EMPs or Awakening is not available to be extracted from the game on the team page, so these cannot be automatically filled out.

## Developer Installation

Using node you can auto build a bookmarklet from the code in `wiki-exporter.js`.
 - Setup the node packages with `npm isntall`
 - Afterwards you use `npm run build` to replace the content of `bookmarklet` with an update verison from the current version of `wiki-exporter.js`
 - If you want to change the input/output file you can use `npx bookmarklet <source> <destination>` or edit the `build` command in `package.json`

  - This is subject to change and might be removed in the future to use the default cache behavior
 - Added assumptions for Support Summons for the Providence, Optimus, and Omega series
